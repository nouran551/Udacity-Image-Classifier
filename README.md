# Udacity-Image-Classifier
AI with Python nanodegree final project,
In this project we implemented an image classification
application. This application will train a deep learning model on a dataset of images. It will then use the
trained model to classify new images. 

In this project, you'll train an image classifier to recognize different species of flowers. You can imagine using something like this in a phone app that tells you the name of the flower your camera is looking at. In practice, you'd train this classifier, then export it for use in your application. We'll be using this dataset of 102 flower categories.
Predict flower name from an image with predict.py along with the probability of that name. That is you'll pass in a single image /path/to/image and return the flower name and class probability
